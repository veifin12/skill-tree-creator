I had to make this for a game im working on. 

I actually didn't HAVE to make this but i got the idea so i decided to make it.

To use it you can drag the skill you want into the canvas you can then double click it to open the skill editor.
If two or more skills have a same group id they get a line connected between them making a connection.
you can also export and import a json which is the way i used this to make my own skill tree in the game.
